# Malware-Analysis-Lab

The Malware Analysis Lab is a project that aim to help during the first stage of an anlysis.
A first overview of the given binary help to understand the purpose of the malware (detection ratio, popular anti-virus results, date of creation, etc ...). A technical overview return the called DLL along with the binary section's name.
Then, some YARA rules are applied on the binary (malware identification, packers, anti-vm, anti-debug and cryptographics artifacts).
Everything is store and save in a local ddb.

So later on, the analyst can compare a sample with it own personnal and custom database.
