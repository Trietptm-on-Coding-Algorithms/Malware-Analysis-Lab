# Malware-Analysis-Lab

## Intro:
The Malware Analysis Lab is a project that aim to help during the first stage of an anlysis.

A first overview of the given binary help to understand the purpose of the malware (detection ratio, popular anti-virus results, date of creation, etc ...). A technical overview return the called DLL along with the binary section's name.

Then, some YARA rules are applied on the binary (malware identification, packers, anti-vm, anti-debug and cryptographics artifacts).
Everything is store and save in a local ddb.

So later on, the analyst can compare a sample with it own personnal and custom database.

The database include a note section where you can add some info about the sample, like the techniques used by the malicious file, some unpacking tutorial, and so on ... It may save some time during futur analysis, help to share sample, writing down everything related to some specific samples, and more important: centralizing everything in one place.
